## This is an app that will tunnel http from knotfree.net to localhost. 

Example of starting a local web service:
This will start a wordpress installation:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose-wp.yml up```

Then, in the UI of this running app add a name, eg john-q-blog and a port of 8087.
Then you will have a wordpress accessible at http://john-q-blog.knotfree.net
